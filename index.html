  <h1>Introduction to Programmining, <span>Nanodegree</span></h1><br>
<h1>Stage 0 Project</h1><br>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p><b>Coding:</b><br>Coding a computer means telling the computer what you want
it to do, by writing 
text in a way the computer understands</p>
<p><b>Nanodegree:</b><br>Nanodegree is a <b>Path</b> from Nothing to gaining new
knowledge, skills to learning new ways of thinking.<br>After this program,<b>
we could chooseto learn</b>:Full stack programming, Frontend Web Development, 
ios development or something else.</p>
<p><b>5 Steps to Thinking Like a Programmer</b><br>
<br>Computer programmers follow has a systematic way of approaching or thinking 
about programs. They follow five different step:<br>
<br><b>1. Procedural Thinking:</b> - Step by step approach to program design and 
creation using clear instructions that the computer understand.<br><br>
<b>2. Abstract Thinking:</b>Using abstract thinkings like 1+1 = 2, 
and finding similarity(generality) amongst things.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Technological Empathy:</b> Knowing how the computer sees things and using that
to write instructions like <b>I'm bold</b> remembering that the computer is stupid
and any little mistake could cause big problems.<br><br>
<b>4. Systems Thinking:</b> - Take a big idea and break it down into component 
pieces. <br><br>
<b>5. Systematic debugging:</b> - look at a program problem, think of possible causes
and find a way to fix it.

<h2>How The Web Works</h2><br>
<p>The <b>Web</b> is a collection of computers that communicate with each other. 
When we type a request on our <em>BROWSERS</em> to a <em>WEB PAGE</em>, the web 
page send our requests through the <em>INTERNET</em> using the <em>HTTP</em>
protocol to the <em>SERVER</em>. The server then sends the 
requested file or document to our browsers through the internet.</p><br>
<p><b><em>HTML</em></b> The web is made up of HTML pages. HTML stands for 
Hypertext Markup Language. 
They form majority of the contents on the web today.  
The components are <em>text contents</em> - the contents we see on a web page and 
<em>markup</em> - which tells the computer how to render the content (we usually
don't see this part).<br>
<b><em>URL</em></b> - The links or the web addresses linked from web pages.
Like, go to <a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity Homepage</a><br>
<b><em>HTTP</em></b> - The protocol that unite the web.<br>
<b><em>Web Applications</em></b> And of course web applications
